5. System specs

- 5.1 Core approach
The RTE system is based on ...
The relatedness system is based on extracting various types of features from the data set, which in combination with word vectors from a CDSM model is used to train a regressor.

- 5.2 Supervised or unsupervised
RTE system: Rule-based
Relatedness system: Supervised

- 5.3 Critical features used

distributional semantic model,
word net distances,
word overlap,
noun overlap,
verb overlap,
agent overlap,
patient overlap,
predicate overlap,
logical instance overlap,
logical relation overlap,
drs relations

- 5.4 Critical tools used
RTE system:
swi-prolog
boxer
nutcracker
tokkie
mace
paradox
vampire

Relatedness system:
python2.7
python-sklearn
python-nltk 
python-requests
python-numpy
python-scipy
python-matplotlib
word2vec

- 5.5 Significant data pre/post-processing
We use the xxl paraphrases file from http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/ppdb/ to create alternative versions of the sentences. The _prepareSICK2.py file checks for all possible replacements and create all possible replacement combination sentences in the sick2 folder.
The script also tries to remove negations in the same way, (by replacing 'no' by 'a' for example).

- 5.6 Other data used (outside of the provided)
wordnet data from nltk
paraphrases from http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/ppdb/
candc trained models from http://svn.ask.it.usyd.edu.au/download/candc/models-1.02.tbz2

We also use word vectors trained using the tool word2vec on the first billion characters of Wikipedia (http://mattmahoney.net/dc/enwik9.zip) and an English gigaword corpus (http://www.statmt.org/wmt11/translation-task.html#download). This data
was cleaned using the scripts available here http://www.statmt.org/wmt08/scripts.tgz.
